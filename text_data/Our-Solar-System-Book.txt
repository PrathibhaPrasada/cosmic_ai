Why I s the Sun G reen

Human eyes see only visible light.   Visible light is made up of all the colors of the 
rainbow (sometimes labeled red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) which, when 
combined, look white to our eyes.  But there are many other, invisible forms of light, i.e. 
the electromagnetic spectrum – radio, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X -rays, gamma 
rays.  The various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are differentiated by their 
wavelengths – radio wavelengths can be kilometers long and gamma ray wavelengths 
smaller than atoms. 
 
Many scientific instruments are designed to detect infrared, ultraviolet, X -ray, or other 
wavelengths.  These invisible forms of light have no colors associated with them.  So 
scientists have their computers assign unusual colors (like neon orange) to their images, 
to allow them to observe details.  The green Sun, above left, is a photo of the Sun taken in 
extreme ultraviolet light, which our eyes cannot see.  The scientists have artificially  
colored the ultraviolet data green.  We call that “false color ”. 
 Scientists also use false color to indicate additional information.  The image of Mars, 
above right, shows the concentration of methane in Mars’s atmosphere.  Scientists have 
color-coded the highest concentrations of methane as red, the lowest in blue, to help us 
and them understand the data.  Many of the images in this collection are likewise false 
colored.  We have tried to highlight which images come from visible l ight and which 
represent false color or color-coded data.

The Sun is our very own star, at the center of our solar system.  The Sun is scientifically 
designated as a yellow dwarf  (because of its place on the HR diagram1).  However, our Sun 
is neither yellow nor a dwarf.  The Sun appears white to the human eye -- it only looks 
yellow or orange when its rays are being scattered by Earth’s atmosphere during sunrise 
and sunset.  And it is now thought to be brighter and larger than about 85% of the stars in 
the Milky Way galaxy, most of which are red dwarfs (stars with low mass that shine in a 
relatively cool red). 
 
The Sun consists of hot plasma (a state of matter where electrons have been stripped from 
their atoms) interwoven with magnetic fields. It has a diameter about 109 times that of 
of Earth, and a million Earths could fit inside it! Its mass accounts for about 99.86% of the 
total mass of the solar system. About three-quarters of the Sun consists of hydrogen; the rest is mostly helium. Less than 2% consists of heavier elements, including oxygen, 
carbon, gold, iron, and others. Many of these elements were originally forged in supernova 
explosions. So we, and everything in our solar system, are made of “star stuff”
2.   
 Every second, the Sun fuses 614 million metric tons of hydrogen into 609 metric tons of 
helium in its core.   The difference is converted into gamma rays that eventually get

 6 radiated at the solar surface as lower-energy 
photons, primarily visible light.  The Sun's 
hot atmosphere, called the corona, continuously 
expands in space creating the solar wind, a stream of 
charged particles that extends beyond the solar 
system. The bubble in the interstellar 
medium formed by the solar wind, called 
the heliosphere, is the largest continuous structure in 
the solar system.

Solar Activity  
Our Sun is a dynamic, active, and constantly changing star.  Solar activity is driven by 
intense magnetic fields, generated deep within the solar interior then buoyantly rising up 
through its surface. Plasma caught in the magnetic field lines allows us to see these fields, 
as in the previous composite image.

On the left is a true color image of the Sun.  The dark splotches are called sunspots.  The 
image on the right, taken at the same time, is a map of the magnetic fields on the Sun.  
White indicates a positive field, and black a negative one (grey indicates little or no field) .  
Note how the sunspots are associated with the magnetic fields – most activity on the Sun 
is a result of complex magnetic fields!

Sunspots are temporary regions of reduced surface temperature caused by increa sed 
magnetic activity. The Sun goes through a cycle of about 11 years when it has a period of many sunspots (solar maximum), then few or no sunspots (solar minimum).   Sunspots or 
similar magnetically active regions  are the source of solar storms. 
 
The Sun’s magnetic fields are constantly in 
motion.  When solar magnetic fields twist, 
break, and then reconnect, they can release 
a tremendous amount of energy.  We see 
these as solar flares, like the white 
brightening near the center of the image on 
the right.  Solar flares eject radiation and fast moving particles that can damage 
satellites, disrupt communications, and 
give high-flying planes and astronauts 
additional doses of radiation.  Finding ways 
to protect astronauts from solar flares is 
one of the biggest challenges of going back 
to the Moon or to Mars.

 8  ESA3/NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric 
Observatory (SOHO) produced the 
spectacular portrait (left) of our star . Featured 
is a huge, handle-shaped prominence—a cloud of relatively cooler plasma held aloft 
high in the corona (the Sun’s atmosphere) by 
a large magnetic field that is rooted in the 
solar surface. A typical prominence extends 
over thousands of kilometers, and can last 
from minutes to months.

Sometimes prominences erupt into coronal mass 
ejections (CMEs), as in the image on the right. These 
huge blasts of charged plasma, traveling at 1400 
km/s, can impact objects  of the solar system. Luckily, 
Earth’s magnetic field acts as a shield, partially protecting us.  But CME impacts on Earth may still 
generate effects such as aurora, satellite drag, power 
outages, communications disruptions, and GPS 
interference.

A close-up view of the Sun's surface, observed by NASA’s Transition Region and 
Coronal Explorer (TRACE) mission, shows vast loop structures made of superheated 
plasma trapped in magnetic field lines.  About 10 Earths could fit across any one of these 
loops! These areas of solar activity can contain multiple loops, often in “tunnel”

 9 formations, that can persist for weeks. The plasma reaches temperatures of mor e than 
1,000,000 C° — whereas the Sun’s surface temperature averages only about 5500 C°! 
Flares and CMEs usually erupt from active regions such as these. 
Space Weather 
 
       
 Image Credit s:  NASA       (Definitely n ot to scale!)  
 
Space weather refers to the affect the Sun has on the Earth and rest of the solar system.  
The solar wind is a fairly constant stream of charged particles , mostly high-energy 
electrons and protons, ejected from the upper atmosphere of the Sun. These particles can 
escape the Sun's gravity because of their high kinetic energy and the high temperature of 
the corona. As the solar wind buffets the Earth’s magnetic field, it distorts it into a long 
oval, as shown in the (not-to-scale) image above.  
 
Radiation storms and CMEs have the potential to seriously affect Earth and our modern 
technology.  Besides triggering beautiful aurorae, these solar storms can damage 
satellites, disrupt power grids and electrical systems, interfere with cell phones and other 
communications, and disturb animal movements. They can even threaten astronauts and 
high-flying airplanes with their radiation!  Space weather affects not only Earth but the 
other planets as well.  
Our Eye on the Sky – Launched in February 
2010, NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory 
(SDO) mission is designed to study the Sun’s 
variability and its effect on space w eather, with 
the goal of eventually predicting dangerous solar activity.

 Mercury is extreme. Of all the planets in our 
solar system, it is the smallest, it has the 
oldest surface, it is closest to the Sun, it has 
the largest daily variations in surf ace 
temperature, and, until recently  it was the 
least explored. NASA’s Mercury Surface, 
Space Environment, Geochemistry, and 
Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft, which 
inserted into Mercury orbit in March 2011 
has changed all that! It has revealed rocky 
Mercury’s geologic history, the nature of its 
weak magnetic field, the structure of its 
core, and the composition of its thin 
exosphere.  MESSENGER has even found 
hints of water at Mercury’s dark poles.

What is the source of the radiating streaks in the image on the left? It is the impact crater 
Hokusai, seen at the top of the frame, named for Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusa i. Its 
impressive ray system extends for as far as 1000km. Such rays are formed when an impact excavates material from beneath the surface and explodes  it outward from the crater. Rays 
such as these fade over time as they are exposed to the harsh space environment. Hence, craters with bright rays are thought to be relatively young.  
 
Above right: At a diameter of 100km, the crater Atget is one of the largest craters within the 
Caloris Basin (see next image).

(false colors)  The image on the left features  the sprawling 
Caloris basin, one of the solar system's 
largest impact basins. Created during the 
early history of the solar system by the 
impact of a large asteroid-size d body, the 
basin spans about 1500 kilometers and is seen in yellowish hues in this enhanced 
color mosaic. The image data is from the 
January 14th flyby of the MESSENGER  
spacecraft. Orange splotches around the basin's perimeter are now thought to be 
volcanic vents, new evidence that Mercury's 
smooth plains are indeed lava flows. 
  
Scientists often add false color to images to

Venus, second planet from the Sun, has roughly the same size, mass, density, and 
composition as Earth. Until the 1960s, scientists and science fiction writers speculated that 
Venus might be very Earth-like, and home to lush, tropical forests. That view changed when 
new observations confirmed a superheated surface with  temperatures over 400C and 
atmospheric pressures nearly a hundred times that of Earth. But the biggest difference from Earth lies within Venus’s atmosphere. The clouds on Venus, which hide its surface, are 
made not of water like they are on Earth, but rather of concentrated sulfuric acid —
essentially battery acid. About 700 million years ago, just before life was diversifying on Earth, Venus experienced tremendous volcanic activity, flooding the surface with new lava 
and filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, causing a runaway greenhouse effect .   
Volcanoes continue to erupt on Venus.  
Only radar can probe through the thick clouds in the Venusian atmosphere to make 
observations of the surface. Radar data collected over many years from multiple sources 
were used to create the beautiful, color-coded portrait of Venus’s surface, above right. 
 
This striking image, right, is 
a composite of the complete 
radar image collection of 
Venus’s surface, obtained 
by NASA’s Magellan 
mission.  The image uses 
simulated colors based on 
actual color images recorded 
by the Soviet Venera 13 and 
14 spacecraft.

ended on October 12, 1994, when radio contact was lost with the spacecraft during its 
controlled descent into the deeper portions of the Venusian atmosphere.

 Was there life on Venus? There is evidence that when it was young, Venus almost 
certainly had liquid water—an essential ingredient for life on Earth. Was Venus habitable in 
the past? Is it habitable now? Finding evidence of past life will be a big challenge, as 
massive volcanic activity caused a resurfacing of 80% of the planet  within the last billion 
years. But if samples are someday returned from the ancient surface of Venus, they could be very revealing!  
 
As for life on Venus now, some scientists speculate that single-celled organisms could 
actually survive within the harsh yet stable atmosphere, living off the sulfur chemistry there!

In December of 1968, the Apollo 8 crew flew from the Earth to the Moon and back again. 
Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders were launched atop a Saturn V rocket, 
circled the Moon ten times in their command module, and returned to Earth on December 
27. As the Apollo 8 command module rounded the farside of the Moon, the crew could 
look toward the lunar horizon and see the Earth appear to rise. The famous picture that resulted, below left, shows a distant blue Earth above the Moon's limb, and was a 
marvelous gift to the world.

For those who have seen them, the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis are spectacles to 
remember. Aurorae are caused by currents of energetic charged particles in Earth's 
magnetosphere flowing through the upper atmosphere. The interaction of the solar wind 
with Earth's magnetosphere drives these currents. The more active the Sun, especial ly 
during the peak of its 11-year solar cycle, the more charged particles flow to Earth’s magnetic poles. These charged particles eventually collide with gas molecules in the 
upper atmosphere, causing them to ionize (lose electrons) and emit colored light.  
 
Earth’s thin atmosphere is all that 
stands between life on Earth and 
the cold, dark void of space. Our 
planet's atmosphere has no clearly 
defined upper boundary but 
gradually thins out into space. 
The layers of the atmosphere have 
different characteris tics, such as 
protective ozone in the stratosphere and weather in the 
lowermost layer. The setting Sun 
seen through Earth’s atmosphere 
is featured in this image, which 
was photographed by the crew of

ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN…one giant leap for mankind! There is only one world in 
our solar system besides Earth on which humans have walked—the Moon. The image 
above was taken by astronauts on the Moon during the Apollo 17 mission in December 
1972. Astronaut Harrison Schmitt is shown preparing to take a soil sample. The later 
Apollo missions, including 17, had a strong scientific f ocus. A few days after this image 
was taken, humanity left the Moon and has yet to  return. Note the Sun in the upper left. It 
is daytime on the Moon, but with no air to scatter the light, the sky remains black.

Virtually everyone can see the Moon, no matter where on Earth they are. Most  people 
know that the Moon’s gravitational pull on the Earth causes our ocean tide s. But did you 
know that missions to the Moon have discovered the existence of Moonquakes, as well as 
wate r ice hidden in the permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles?  
 The lunar samples brought back by Apollo astronauts have shed new light on how the 
Moon was formed—it is now thought that roughly 4.5 billion years ago, a rocky impactor about the size of Mars hit the young Earth. The debris scattered by that collision orbited 
the Earth briefly (only about a month!) before coalescing into the Moon.  The Moon was 
further struck by a heavy bombardment of asteroids around 3.9 billion years ago , causing 
much of the cratering now seen.   The dark blotches on the Earth-facing side of the Moon are lunar mare, essentially large, dark pla ins of basalt formed by volcanic eruptions.

Image Credit  Akira Fujii/Ciel et Espace  Why does the Moon have a reddish 
hue in these images of a lunar eclipse? 
It is the same reason that the Sun 
appears reddish during a sunset: 
scattered light. During a lunar eclipse, 
the Earth is situated directly between 
the Sun and the Moon. The only 
sunlight reaching the Moon travels 
through dense layers of Earth's 
atmosphere. Atmospheric particles 
preferentially scatter out shorter 
(bluer) wavelengths leaving only the 
longer (redder) wavelengths to refract 
(bend) through the atmosphere and 
illuminate the Moon. 
Meteors and Impacts  
 
Image Credit:  Wally Pacholka/AstroPics.com   
The meteor fireball on the left, caused 
by a Geminid meteor, is one of the 
largest ever recorded. Most meteor 
showers result from debris that “boils” 
off a comet when it passes close to the 
Sun. When Earth passes through the 
debris, these specks may enter our 
atmosphere and we see a meteor 
shower! 
 
Though most particles which cause our 
brilliant meteors are about the size of a grain of sand, t he Geminids are different. Their 
source of meteors is not a comet, but a strange, rocky object thought to be either an 
asteroid or an extinct or dormant comet.  
 Meteors that are larger than a grain of sand (often chunks from asteroids) can sometimes 
reach the Earth’s surface, as  did the rock on the left image below. This one landed  in the 
Sudan desert. Meteors that make it to the ground  are called meteorites; large ones can 
leave impact craters  (2 images below right).

The Red Planet 
 
     Image Credit: NASA/Mars Global Surveyor  Mars has been the subject of  intense study 
for centuries. Its exploration has been 
wrought with success and failure, and has 
witnessed a dramatic evolution in 
knowledge. Speculations about the famous 
“irrigation canals” on Mars in the late 
1800s were finally put to rest by images 
returned from NASA’s Mariner 4 mission 
in 1965. Revealing icy deserts, impact 
craters and a barren landscape, they 
dispelled thoughts of thriving, agricultural 
civilizations. In the 1970s NASA’s Viking 
mission carried out life-detection 
experiments on the surface. The results, 
suggesting a lifeless planet, raised more 
questions than answers.  
 
The next two decades were met with struggle as several spacecraft from the US, Japan, 
Europe, and former USSR were lost.  Success resurfaced in the late 1990s with the ESA 
orbiter Mars Express and NASA’s Pathfinder rover, and Global Surveyor and Odyssey 
orbiters—heralding the mantra “Follow the Water.” In 2004, NASA’s twin rovers Spirit 
and Opportunity began work. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix lander 
followed. As data from these robotic explorers piled up, so did evidence that Mars 
preserves a record of surface liquid water and possibly once-habitable environments. 
NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory, which arrived in 2012, carried an unprecedented suite of instruments that can bring us one step closer to determining if life ever started on 
Mars. Its Curiosity rover is now offering a human-like perspective to martian landscapes.  
 
ESA's Mars Express obtained this view 
of an unnamed impact crater located on 
Vastitas Borealis, a broad plain that 
covers much of Mars' s far northern 
latitudes. The circular patch of bright material is residual water ice. The 
colors are very close to natural, but the 
vertical relief has been exaggerated 
three times. This patch of ice is present 
all year, remaining after frozen carbon 
dioxide overlaying it disappears during 
the martian summer.

Photo Library  NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter space-
craft took this spectacular image of Victoria 
Crater, an impact crater near the equator of Mars 
where hematite mineral deposits suggest Mars 
had a wet past. Layered sedimentary rocks are 
exposed along the inner wall of the crater, and 
the floor of the crater is occupied by a striking 
field of sand dunes. NASA’s twin Mars 
Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have 
been operating on the surface of Mars in search 
of answers about the history of water on the Red 
Planet since 2004 (unfortunately, Spirit was 
turned off ). Five days before this image was 
taken in September 2006, the ‘Opportunity’ rover arrived at the rim of Victoria Crater, after a 
drive of more than 9km! It explored within the 
crater, staying at the site for about a year. The 
rover can actually be seen in this image as a 
small dot at the ‘ten o'clock’ position along the 
crater rim.

Chasma Boreale, pictured above, is a long valley that cuts deep into the north polar ice 
cap of Mars. Where the ice cap has retreated, sand from earlier, less icy climatic regimes 
is exposed. Winds have shaped them into dunes. In 2007, NASA’s Phoenix mission 
landed in the northern arctic plains of Mars to study th e history of water and potential 
habitability in the ice-rich soil. Phoenix verified the presence of water ice in the martian sub-surface, and found calcium carbonate, an indicator of a less acidic (more potentially 
habitable) planet in the past. Phoenix even observed snow falling from clouds in the 
martian atmosphere! This eerily Earth -like vista was made by combining data from 
NASA's Mars Odyssey and Global Surveyor orbiters.

The intriguing image on the left depicts the Nili Fossae region of Mars, which occupies 
an area between a large volcano and an ancient impact basin. It is home to a collection of 
curved troughs cutting about 500m into the crust. The European spacecraft Mar s Express 
detected clay minerals there, good news for astrobio logists because the clays suggest the 
presence of water at some point in the past. Even better, the minerals also suggest that the 
water collected in pools on the surface, a possibly comfortable habitat for life.  
 
Signs of water on Mars, above right, were discovered some time ago but scientists had no 
idea about much of the mineral composition of Mars. A recent di scovery suggests that 
much of the planet was covered with water around 4 billion years ago.   
 
Astrobiologists have also detected the presence of methane gas in the atmosphere of 
Mars, indicating that the planet is indeed “alive,” either in a geologic or biologic sense. It 
is still unclear whether the methane was produced by purely geologic processes such as 
the oxidation of iron, or by microscopic organisms living in the martian sub-surface. 
Finding plumes of it that persist only during the martian spring and summer indicates that 
some ongoing, seasonal process is releasing the gas. Methane-producing microbes were one of the earliest forms of life on Earth, so if there is life on Mars today, it could be 
making the methane from carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere.  
 
 It may look like a familiar sight, but 
this sunset is not from Earth. This 
lovely, otherworldly evening was 
captured by the rover Spirit in 2005 as 
it peered toward the western sky from 
its perch in Gusev Crater on Mars. Like 
no other spacecraft, the Mars 
Exploration Rovers have afforded us a 
perspective much like our own on 
another world, making Mars feel that 
much more like home.

fearsome Phobos, taking its name from 
the Greek word for fear.  It is one of two 
moons of Mars -- and this moon is 
doomed!  Phobos orbits very close to 
Mars, and the strong gravitational (i.e. 
tidal) forces are taking their toll. In about 100 million years, Phobos will likely be 
shattered by the stress of these relentless 
tidal forces. The debris may form a ring 
around Mars.

There are millions of asteroids, ranging in diameter from dust particles to 950km. Like 
most other small solar system bodies, asteroids are thought to be the shattered remnants 
of planetesimals, bodies within the young Sun’s solar nebula that never grew large 
enough to become planets.  Most known asteroids orbit in the main asteroid belt between 
the orbits of Mars and Jupiter or co-orbital with Jupiter. However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the near-Earth asteroids.   In the image above 
right, Ida and Gaspra (superimposed with each other) are two such rocky, metallic 
objects. Shown here to the same scale, Ida is about 30km long, and Gaspra about 17km.

Asteroids have played a role in the 
evolution of life on Earth. 
Sometimes the orbits of asteroids 
bring them close to Earth and 
collisions ensue. There is strong 
evidence that the mass extinction 
that killed the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was caused by an asteroid 
at least 12km wide. If that had not 
happened, would humans be 
walking the Earth today?

the asteroid belt.  Giuseppe Piazzi 
discovered Ceres in 1801. It was initially 
classified as a planet.  As other objects 
were discovered in the area it was realized 
that Ceres represented the first of a class 
of many similar small bodies.

Jupiter, the most massive planet in our solar system—with 79 known moons and an 
enormous magnetic field (magnetosphere) — forms a kind of miniature solar system. 
Gaseous Jupiter resembles a star in composition, but it never grew massive enough to 
start the fusion process. Several of its moons are of interest to astrobiologists searching 
for life elsewhere in the solar s ystem. 
 The image above left shows Jupiter’s true colors. The right image has been color-coded 
to show cloud height from high altitude (white) through mid -range (blue) to low altitude 
(red).  
  
 
Image Credit: JPL/NASA  Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, a vast cyclone located 
in Jupiter’s southern hemisphere, is about three 
times the diameter of Earth and is visible even 
through small backyard telescopes. The colors 
change as different chemicals and gases are 
churned up from the bottom layers to the 
“surface” of the gaseous planet. The winds at the 
edge of the spot can reach up to 550km per hour. 
This long-lasting storm was probably first 
observed by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in the 
late 1600s. It was not seen  up close until NASA’s 
Pioneer 10 spacecraft made its flyby in 1974.

water condenses to form clouds, 
Jupiter's clouds are made of 
ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and 
water. Jupiter's many jet streams 
shear clouds apart, forming 
characteristic streaks. The fastest jet 
stream winds blow eastward at 
480km per hour. The most energetic 
features are the small, bright clouds 
to the left of the Great Red Spot—

  Jupiter  
 27 Io 
 
Image C redit: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona  This image shows Io, the closest  to Jupiter of its 
moons and one of  the most interesting. About the 
size of Earth’s Moon, Io is the most volcanically 
active body in the solar system. Io’s volcanoes 
erupt massive volumes of silicate lava, sulfur, and 
sulfur dioxide hundreds of kilometers above the 
surface, constantly changing Io's appearance. The 
irregular depressions on the surface, known as 
paterae, often correspond to active volcanic centers 
and have many straight edges and sharp angles, 
suggesting they are related to fractures in Io's 
crust. In many cases lava can be seen to erupt from 
them.  Io’s intense volcanism is a result of 
frictional heating of its interior due to bending and 
curving caused by the gravitational pull of Jupiter.  
 
Europa

Arizona  
Above are two views of Jupiter's icy moon Europa, about the size of Earth’s Moon. The 
left side shows the approximate natural color appearance, while on the right is a false-
color composite including infrared data. Dark brown areas represent salty material 
derived from the interior. Long, dark lines are fractures in the crust, some more than 
3,000km long!   
Habitat for life?  Europa excites astrobiologists because of its potential to host life in the 
100km thick liquid water ocean that scientists think exists beneath its icy exterior.  Europa 
has many volcanoes, and entire ecosystems have been found thriving near volcanoes (hydrothermal vents) on Earth’s seafloor, which serve as analogues to what may exist on 
Europa.  Europa’s ocean is covered with a shell of ice about 20km thick which forms the 
outer surface of the moon. Jupiter’s gravitational pull raises and lowers the sea beneath 
the ice, causing extreme tides. These in turn keep Europa’s icy surface in motion, and are 
probably the cause of the cracks and streaks. The same gravitational pull that affects the 


--- Page 28 (text layer) ---
Our Solar System  
 28 ocean tides is also thought to heat Europa’s core, keeping the water from freezing 
entirely, and driving geological activity. With both liquid water and a stab le source of 
energy present, it is no wonder astrobiologists think Europa could be a habitat for extraterrestrial life!  
Ganymeade 
 
Image credit:  NAS A Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, 
8% larger than the planet Mercury! Ganymede is 
composed of about equal amounts of  silicate 
rock and water ice, with an iron-rich, liquid core. A saltwater ocean is believed to exist nearly 
200km below Ganymede's surface, sandwiched 
between layers of ice.  The satellite has a 
thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O
2 and 
possibly O 3 (ozone). 
 
Ganymede’s surface is composed of two main types 
of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years  
ago, cover about a third of the satellite.  Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves 
and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light 
terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but it was likely the result of tectonic 
activity brought about by the gravitation forces (i.e. tidal heating) by Jupiter.    
 Ganymede is the only satellite in the solar system known to possess a magnetosphere 
(protective magnetic shield) , likely created through convection within the liquid iron 
core. The meager magnetosphere is buried within Jupiter's much larger  magnetic 
field and connected to it through open field lines.  Whether the satellite has  an ionosphere 
associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.  
Callisto  
 
Image Credit: NASA  Callisto, about the size of Mercury, has the most 
heavily cratered and oldest surface in the solar 
system. NASA’s Galileo mission (1989-2003) 
observed Callisto, revealing evidence for a 
subsurface saltwater ocean—the same sort of 
evidence for the ocean scientists think exists on Europa. Can life emerge and thrive in such cold, 
lightless oceans? If there’s life in one of these two 
oceans, it is more likely to be Europa’s. The ocean 
there receives more heat because of Europa’s 
stronger gravitational relationship with Jupiter. 
Callisto’s ocean, if it exists, is so deep that dense, 
high-pressure phases of ice will form at the ocean 
bottom, possibly blocking liquid water and rock 
from interacting directly to create conditions for life .

Ringworld 
 
 
Image Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute  
 
Gaseous Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar 
system, behind Jupiter.  Despite their imposing 
appearance, the glorious rings around Saturn are only 
about 10m thick! The rings consist of billions of 
individual particles of mostly water ice. Interactions 
with the gravitational field of Saturn’s moons create 
waves, wakes, and other structures. Tiny moons orbit 
within gaps in the rings, keeping the gaps open. 
Scientists still are not sure exactly how old the rings are 
nor how they were formed. But it is clear that the rings 
we observe today were not all created in the same way.   
 
 
NASA’s Cassini mission discovered that a great plume of icy material emanating from     
Saturn’s moon Enceladus is a major source of material for the expansive E ring. Cassini 
has also discovered new ringlets, a moon that is stealing particles from the narrow F ring, 
and features within the rings shaped like straw and rope.

 31 Saturn’s  82 Moons,  including Titan, Enceladus, Iapetus, 
Hyperion, Phoebe 
Saturn has at least 62 moons, ranging in size from just under 3km to about 5000km. Two 
of the moons, Titan and Enceladus, are of great interest to astrobiologists: Titan provides 
an analogue to the chemistry of early Earth, and Enceladus’ s inner heat and jets of ice 
and water vapor could be a habitat for extraterr estrial life. 
 
Titan (and Tethys)  
 
 
Image Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute  Titan is the largest of the moons 
orbiting Saturn. Until very recently, our 
view of Titan was much as it is 
depicted here: a hazy, orange sphere. 
NASA’s Cassini mission changed all 
that. Cassini and the Huygens probe it 
launched into Titan’s surface relayed 
data back to Earth about the atmosphere 
and weather it encountered. Revealed 
(see images below) was a world that 
looked a lot like home, with surface 
features like riverbeds, vast deserts 
covered in dunes, and even lakes filled 
not with water, but liquid 
hydrocarbons—much like the fuel we 
put into our cars! These lakes are the 
first open bodies of liquid found 
anywhere besides Earth. 
Also in the above portrait is one of Saturn’s smaller moons, Tethys.  Tethys is thought to 
be made mostly of water ice.  Its dominating surface feature is a giant impact cr ater 
called Odysseus Crater, which is two-fifths the diameter of Tethys itself.  
 
Image Credit: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona (false colors)  
NASA’s Cassini spacecraft peered through Titan’s atmosphere to obtain the false-color 
views (above) of its surface.  Despite its distance from the Sun, Titan is arguably one of 


--- Page 32 (text layer) ---
Our Solar System  
 32 the most Earth-like worlds we have found to date. With its thick atmosphere and complex, 
carbon-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, 
before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Titan's surface is shaped by 
rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane, which form clouds and occasionally rain 
from the sky as water does on Earth. Winds sculpt vast regions of dark dunes that girdle 
the equator and low latitudes. Volcanism may occur as well, b ut with liquid water lava 
instead of  molten rock lava like on Earth. 
Enceladus

Close fly-bys of NASA’s Cassini spacecraft revealed an array of narrow linear cracks 
straddling Enceladus’s south pole, a region of relatively hig her temperature. Visible in 
the false-color composite image on the left, they are called ‘tiger stripes,’ and are fissures in the surface where jets are spraying icy particles, water vapor, and organic compounds. 
Many jets erupt all along the tiger stripes, and the vigor of individual jets can vary with 
time. Some scientists think that the warmer the temperatures are at the surface, the greater 
the likelihood that jets are erupting from liquid. If true, could this liquid subsurface environment enriched with organic molecules be a possible habitat for extraterrestrial life? 
The image above right shows, in spectacular false-color, a view of jets on the surface of 
Enceladus spurting their ice particles, water vapor, and trace organic molecules  into space! 
 
Iapetus  
Iapetus has been called the ‘yin and yang’ of Saturn’s moons because the surface of one 
of its hemispheres is dark, about as reflective as coal, while the other is much brighter.  
The original dark material is believed to have come from outside Iapetus, but now it 


--- Page 33 (text layer) ---
  Saturn  
 33 consists of lag from the sublimation of ice from the warmer areas of Iapetus's surface. It 
contains organic compounds similar to the substances found in primitive meteorites or on 
the surface of comets.  
 
Image Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute   
Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cassini -Huygens Mission  
 
In the image above left, a huge impact crater can be seen in the south, spanning a 
tremendous 450 kilometers. It appears superposed on an older crater of similar size. The 
dark material mentioned previously is seen increasingly coating the easternmost part of 
Iapetus, darkening craters and highlands alike. Close inspection indicates that the dark 
coating typically faces the moon's equator and is less than a meter thick. A leading 
hypothesis is that the dark material is mostly dirt leftover when relatively warm but dirty 
ice sublimates. An initial coating of dark material may have been effectively painted on 
by the accretion of meteor-liberated debris from other moons. 
 
The image above right shows a prominent feature of Iapetus -- an equatorial ridge that 
runs along the center of Cassini Regio. It was discovered when the Cassini spacecraft 
imaged Iapetus in 2004. Peaks in the ridge rise more than 20  km above the surrounding 
plains, making them some of the tallest mountains in the Solar System.  
Hyperion 
 
Sponge or moon? This stunning image of  Hyperion, following, has been enhanced to 
reveal crisp details across the strange, tumbling moon’s surface. Scientists think 
Hyperion's somewhat potato-shaped appearance can be attributed to its unusually low 
density for such a large object, giving it weak surface gravity and high porosity. Hyperion’s craters are particularly deep and there appear  to have been landslides inside 
many of the larger ones. The result is a curious look, somewhat like the surface of a sponge or a wasp nest. Many of the crater walls on Hyperion are bright, suggesting an 
abundance of water ice.

Phoebe  
 
Image Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute   
Phoebe's orbit around Saturn is in the opposite 
direction than the orbits of most objects in the solar 
system. This suggests Phoebe was a captured object, 
trapped by Saturn’s gravitational pull and brought 
into orbit. Scientists think Phoebe might have been 
part of an ancestral population of small, icy bodies 
called Centaurs which originated in the outer solar 
system but migrated inward. Centaurs are of special 
interest to scientists because they are thought to be 
primordial objects—leftovers of solar system 
formation that never coalesced  into a planet. If 
indeed it is a captured Centaur, then images and scientific data of Phoebe taken by NASA’s Cassini 
spacecraft give scientists the first opportunity to 
study a Centaur.

Uranus, third largest planet in our solar

William Herschel in 1781, and shares its 
name with the Greek god of the sky. Most 
of what we know about Uranus came from 
the NASA Voyager 2 spacecraft’s flyby of 
the planet in 1986. Uranus has nine major, 
though extremely faint, rings and 27 
known moons.

Because the human eye cannot detect infrared light, false colors were assigned to the

The rings of Uranus are extremely faint in visible light, but quite prominent in the near

circumference. Its widest and thus brightest part is at the t op in this image. Two fainter, 
inner rings are visible next to the epsilon ring.

Sun of the hydrogen and helium gas giants in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere acts 
as a dark veil to the surface below. We do know that it has at least 14 moons and a faint 
ring system, and takes almost 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun. Neptune's atmosphere 
extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a 
heavier, approximately Earth -sized, solid core. In 1989, NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft 
tracked a large, oval-shaped storm called the ‘Great Dark Spot’ (similar to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter). In 1994 when NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope imaged the planet, no 
sign of the Great Dark Spot could be seen.

Triton is the largest by far of Neptune’s 14 known moons. This beautiful portrait is a 
false-color mosaic taken in 1989 by NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraf t. Triton is one of only 
a few objects in the solar system known to have a nitrogen-dominated atmosphere (the others are Earth, Saturn's moon Titan, and Pluto). Its frozen surface is made primarily of 
nitrogen ice, with some methane ice at the so uth pole. Voyager 2 observed active geyser-
like plumes erupting from the surface, perhaps like those active now on Saturn’s moon 
Enceladus. Like Phoebe’s orbit around Saturn, Triton orbits Neptune in the opposite 
direction than the orbits of most objects in the solar system.

 40 The Kuiper Belt, Dwarf Planets, Trans -Neptunian 
Objects, and Comets 
 
 
Artist conception from NASA  
 
The Kuiper belt is a region of the outer solar system, extending from the orbit of Neptune 
(at 30 AU4) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.  It is similar to the asteroid belt, 
though far larger — 20 times as wide. Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small 
bodies, remnants from the solar system's formation. But while the asteroid belt is composed primarily of rock and metals, Kuiper belt objects are made of rocks and frozen 
ices such as methane, ammonia and water . The Kuiper belt is home to Pluto, Eris, and 
other dwarf planets and is a source of comets 
Dwarf Planets  
The International Astronomical Union defines a dwarf planet as a celestial body in direct orbit of the Sun
 that is massive enough for its shape to be controlled by gravitation (i.e. is 
round), but that unlike a planet has not cleared its orbital region of other objects. There may be hundreds to thousands of dwarf planets in the solar system. We currently have 
named five: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.   Ceres resides in the asteroid 
belt.  The other 4 are part of the Kuiper belt or are trans -Neptunian objects.

 41 Trans- Neptunian Objects  
 
A trans-Neptunian object (TNO ) is any object in the solar system that orbits the Sun at a 
greater average distance than Neptune, hence including objects in the Oort Cloud (more 
later) as well as the Kuiper belt. 
 
Sedna is a large trans-Neptunian object, which in 2012 was about three times as far from 
the Sun as Neptune. Like other TNOs its surface is largely a mixture of water, methane 
and nitrogen ices, though it is also one of the reddest in the solar system. It is probably a dwarf planet. Sedna’s exceptionally long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 
11,400 years to complete, and distant point of closest approach  to the Sun, at 76 AU, 
have led some astronomers to conclude that it is the first known member of the inner Oort cloud.

 42 Comets

Most comets originate from the Kuiper belt, having been nudged out of their orbits by 
collisions or the gravity of a passing star.  Would there be life on Earth without comets? 
There is increasing evidence that water  and organic molecules, both needed for life to 
form, were partially delivered to the early Earth by comets. Comets are enriched with water ice. Studies of comet Halley in 1986 revealed it to be some of the most organic -rich 
material ever meas ured in the solar system, NASA’s 2004 Stardust Mission to Comet 
Wild 2 found a range of complex hydrocarbon molecules, and NASA’s 2005 Deep 
Impact mission to Comet Tempel 1 discovered a mixture of organic and clay particles. 
Scientists think comet impacts and deliveries were a common occurrence in the early 
solar system, but still question if Earth’s water was incorporated as it formed or was a result of cometary impacts after formation was complete.

 To the left is a close up of comet 
Hartley 2. After its encounter with 
comet Tempel 1 in 2005, NASA 
recycled its Deep Impact 
spacecraft and deployed it on a 
new mission, EPOXI, to 
investigate comet Hartley 2, 
hoping to understand how comets 
form and evolve by comparing 
EPOXI observations with prior 
observations of other comets!  
 
The spacecraft made its closest approach with Hartley 2 on November 4, 2010.  
Preliminary observations show a very active comet! The main region of jet activity originates from the rough lobe on the Sun-facing side of the nucleus. It is powered by the 
release of subsurface carbon dioxide, propelling water ice and dust into the coma (the 
comet’s extremely tenuous atmosphere) . As scientists continue to study the data, they are 
able to track the jets to individual topographic features on the comet’s nucleus. Yet as 
more observations arise, so do more questions .

  Where Are We     
 43 Interplanetary Dust Particles

Space is not empty.  Certainly the smallest “bodies” in the s olar system, interplanetary 
dust particles, or IDPs, are microscopic. This one (above left) is about a tenth the width 
of a human hair, and is composed of glass, carbon, and a conglomeration of silicate 
mineral grains (akin to beach sand). IDPs are bits of material from the early days of our 
solar system. They can be captured then later ejected by a passing comet. This IDP was 
collected by an aircraft flying high  in Earth’s atmosphere. In 2004, NASA’s STARDUST 
mission passed through the tail of comet Wild 2, collecting cometary particles  and 
returning them to Earth for study. Primitive material like this offers scientists a glimpse 
into the conditions of the early solar s ystem. 
 When large versions of these dust particles chance to enter Earth’s atmosphere, they may 
appear as bright meteors (above right)!

Our Solar System  
 44 The Sun’s Heliosphere  
 
Image credit:  NASA  
 
The heliosphere is an immense magnetic bubble, originating from the Sun, surrounding 
and enveloping our solar system and blocking out many of the dangerous cosmic rays 
coming from our galaxy.  It is depicted here as a bubble in space "blown" into 
the interstellar medium (the hydrogen and helium gas that permeates the  galaxy) by 
the solar wind. Although electrically neutral atoms from the interstellar medium can 
penetrate this bubble, virtually all of the material in the heliosphere emanates from 
the Sun itself.  
 
For the first ten billion kilometers of its radius, the solar wind travels at over a million 
kilometers per hour. As it begins to drop out with the interstellar medium, it slows down 
before finally ceasing altogether. The point where th e solar wind slows down is 
the Termination Shock. After the Termination Shock is the heliosheath area.  T hen comes 
the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance – the 
heliopause. The point where the interstellar medium, traveling in the opposite direction, 
slows down as it collides with the heliosphere is the bow shock.  
 
It was thought for decades that the heliosphere extends in a long comet-like heliotail, but 
in 2009 data from Cassini and IBEX show a different shape. The heliosheath area is not 
smooth but filled with magnetic bubbles pushed out by the solar wind.

 45 Where Are We?  
 
 
Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is home to our solar system, Earth, a black hole at its center, 
plus 200-400 billion stars.  Our solar system is located about two-thirds of the way out from the center of the galaxy, on the inner edge of the Orion Arm. The Sun orbits the 
center of the galaxy in a galactic year—once every 225-250 million Earth years.  Besides 
stars, the Milky Way is estimated to have at least 50 billion planets, 500 million of which 
could be located in the habitable zone of their parent star.  New data suggest there may be 
up to twice as many free-floating planets (planets no longer attached to their stars) in the 
Milky Way as there are stars. Our Milky Way is one of around 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe.

 46 Our Immense Universe  
The Hubble Ultra-Deep Field image below is of a tiny region of  space in the 
constellation Fornax, composited from Hubble Space Telescope data accumulated over a 
period from September 24, 2003 through January 16, 2004. It is the deepest image of 
the universe ever taken, looking back approximately 13 billion years (to between 400 and 
800 million years after the Big Bang). This image was taken in an “empty” section of the 
sky with a low density of bright stars in the near-field, allowing much better viewing of 
dimmer, more distant objects. The image contains an estimated 10,000 galaxies.

 Our Sun is only one of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy.  And the Milky Way is 
only one of billions of galaxies in the universe. Do you think we are alone?

In 1990, upon request by Carl Sagan, 
NASA commanded the Voyager 1 
spacecraft, having completed its primary 
mission and now leaving the solar 
system, to turn its camera around to take 
a final photograph of Earth across a 
great expanse of space.  The Pale Blue 
Dot is this photograph of planet 
Earth from over 6 billion kilometers 
away, showing it against the vastness of 
space.
